- Improved exception messages to make them slightly more user-friendly.

### v4.7.1 (17-May-2019)

- Improved exception messages for cases when a video is blocked in user's country or is age-restricted and unembeddable.

### v4.7 (12-May-2019)

- Fixed an issue where YoutubeExplode always failed to extract media streams due to recent YouTube changes.

### v4.6.8 (30-Mar-2019)

- Improved performance in `GetVideoAsync` by optimizing description parser.

### v4.6.7 (16-Mar-2019)

- Fixed some more inconsistencies with how links in video descriptions are rendered.

### v4.6.6 (24-Feb-2019)

- Fixed some inconsistencies with how links in video descriptions are rendered.

### v4.6.4 (16-Jan-2019)

- Pinned AngleSharp dependency to version 0.9.11 because newer versions contain breaking changes that are currently incompatible with YoutubeExplode.
- Improved the implementation of `GetChannelAsync` so that it's more fast and works on channels without any uploaded videos.

### v4.6.3 (13-Jan-2019)

- Fixed an issue where closed caption tracks were sometimes missing whitespace between words in auto-generated tracks.
- Added an extension method to get all distinct video quality labels from a set -- `MediaStreamInfoSet.GetAllVideoQualityLabels`.

### v4.6.2 (04-Jan-2019)

- Fixed an issue where `GetVideoMediaStreamInfosAsync` returned empty for live stream recording videos.

### v4.6.1 (03-Dec-2018)

- Fixed sporadic failures in `GetVideoAuthorChannelAsync` and `GetChannelIdAsync`.
- Re-added `VideoRequiresPurchaseException` as a child of `VideoUnplayableException`.

### v4.6 (23-Nov-2018)

- Switched majority of video-related parsing to a new approach, which allows circumventing signature deciphering, provides more info, and is marginally faster and more consistent. This makes `GetVideoMediaStreamInfosAsync` complete twice as fast, on average.
- Switched from itag-based property mapping to manual string parsing, which should be more stable in the long run.
- Added `MediaStreamInfoSet.ValidUntil` property which can be used to determine when the contained streams will expire.

- Removed `MediaStreamInfo.GetUrlExpiryDate` extension method.
- Removed `VideoRequiresPurchaseException` and replaced it with `VideoUnplayableException` which covers a wider spectrum of errors.
- `VideoUnavailableException` no longer has properties for error code and error reason. Error code was basically useless so it was removed, error reason is now part of the `Message` property.

### v4.5 (20-Oct-2018)

- Fixed an issue where external links were truncated in `Video.Description` if they are too long.
- Added support for seeking in `MediaStream`.

### v4.4 (20-Oct-2018)

- Improved `GetVideoAsync`, `GetVideoAuthorChannelAsync` and `GetVideoClosedCaptionTrackInfosAsync` so that they don't fail on unavailable videos.

- Added static methods to parse and validate YouTube usernames.

### v4.3.4 (16-Oct-2018)

- Fixed an issue where `JsonReaderException` was thrown on all videos due to recent YouTube changes.
- Added support for itag 394.
- Added `GetChannelIdAsync` method that retrieves channel ID from username.

### v4.3.2 (11-Sep-2018)

- Fixed an issue where `ParseException` was thrown on signature-protected videos due to recent YouTube changes.

### v4.3.1 (28-Aug-2018)

- Fixed an issue where retrieving some streams may throw a 403 HTTP error due to recent YouTube changes.

### v4.3 (25-Jul-2018)

- Reworked `GetMediaStreamAsync` so that it implements the workaround for rate-limited streams, which was originally only available in `DownloadMediaStreamAsync`. This is achieved by returning a stream that internally sends multiple segmented requests in a sequence.
- Fixed `MediaStream.ReadAsync` not using the `ReadAsync` of the underlying stream.
- Fixed `GetVideoQualityLabel` so that it displays the framerate as rounded up to the nearest 10, instead of always displaying it as '60'.

### v4.2.8 (14-Jun-2018)

- Fixed an issue where some non-embeddable videos could not be processed.

### v4.2.7 (09-Jun-2018)

- Fixed an issue where non-embeddable age-restricted videos could not be processed.
- Fixed exception messages not being shown in Visual Studio's exception popup.
- Fixed xml docs on `Playlist.Type` property.

### v4.2.6 (09-Jun-2018)

### v4.2.5 (20-May-2018)

- Relaxed validation rules for all playlist IDs because there are even more variations than expected.

### v4.2.4 (02-May-2018)

- Fixed an issue where `GetVideoAuthorChannelAsync` would always throw an exception due to recent YouTube changes.

### v4.2.3 (22-Apr-2018)

- Added an extension method to parse `MediaStreamInfo.Url` expiry date -- `MediaStreamInfo.GetUrlExpiryDate`.
- Replaced instances of `DateTime` with `DateTimeOffset`.
- Relaxed validation rules for RD playlist IDs because there are simply too many possible variations.

### v4.2.2 (31-Mar-2018)

- Fixed some playlist IDs being considered invalid even though they aren't.

### v4.2.1 (28-Mar-2018)

- Fixed an `OutOfMemoryException` issue that would occur when executing `GetVideoMediaStreamInfosAsync` on a large video.

### v4.2 (24-Mar-2018)

- Added overloads for `DownloadMediaStreamAsync` and `DownloadClosedCaptionTrackAsync` that accept `Stream` as output.
- Removed `IHttpService`, `HttpService` in favor of using unwrapped `HttpClient`.
- Added `IYoutubeClient` to aid in testing.

### v4.1.1 (20-Feb-2018)

- Fixed an issue where `GetClosedCaptionTrackAsync` would throw on some malformed automatic captions.
- Fixed an issue where some video qualities were not correctly identified due to itag inconsistency.
- Added support for 2880p video quality.

### v4.1 (02-Feb-2018)

- Implemented segmented downloading for rate-limited media streams. This fixes slow download speed of `DownloadMediaStreamAsync` caused by YouTube changes.
- Added `SearchVideosAsync` method to `YoutubeClient`. Can be used to search for videos using given query. The method returns `Video` objects but not all properties have valid values, due to how this internal API functions.
- Added `HlsLiveStreamUrl` to `MediaStreamInfoSet` which can be used to extract URL of M3U8 playlists for livestream videos.
- Added `UploadDate` to `Video`.
- Fixed incorrect return value in `GetVideoQualityLabel`/`VideoQualityLabel` in cases where FPS was below 60 but above 30.
- Renamed `GetRegularUrl` extension methods to `GetUrl`.
- Added some useful extension methods for models.
- Added some ReSharper annotations.

### v4.0 (15-Dec-2017)

- Reworked `YoutubeClient` API by splitting workflows into separate methods. What was done solely by `GetVideoAsync` is now done by `GetVideoAsync`, `GetVideoMediaStreamInfosAsync`, `GetVideoClosedCaptionTrackInfosAsync`, `GetVideoAuthorChannelAsync`.
- Media stream and closed caption track information is no longer part of the `Video` model. Extended channel information was also removed.
- `PlaylistVideo` has been removed as it now shares the same property set with `Video`. Existing usages of `PlaylistVideo` have been replaced with `Video`.
- Order of some parameters in `Playlist` constructor has been changed. Be careful if you initialize it yourself.
- Removed some properties from `Channel` that are no longer accessible due to YouTube changes.
- Exception messages now provide more information, without needing to check inside properties.
- `ValidatePlaylistId` and `(Try)ParsePlaylistId` are now more strict and check the first two characters in the ID as well.
- Added a lot of useful extensions methods. Refactored some existing methods to extensions.
- Fixed incompatibility with age-restricted videos due to YouTube changes.
- Fixed other issues that prevented the library from being usable due to YouTube changes.
- Added dependency on `Newtonsoft.Json` and `AngleSharp`.

This version has a lot of breaking changes and the migration isn't very straightforward. The readme has been updated with new usage examples and demo projects have been changed to work with new API.
