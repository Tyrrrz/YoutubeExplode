### v6.2.1 (08-Aug-2022)

- Fixed an issue where calling `StreamClient.GetManifestAsync(...)` failed with an error saying `The following content is not available on this app`. (Thanks [@Curtis Caulfield](https://github.com/codedbycurtis))

### v6.2 (29-Jun-2022)

- Added support for retrieving channel metadata using custom channel URL. You can do that via `ChannelClient.GetBySlugAsync(...)`. To parse a channel slug out of a custom channel URL, use `ChannelSlug.Parse(...)`.

### v6.1.2 (16-Apr-2022)

- Updated documentation on `Engagement.DislikeCount` and `Engagement.AverageRating` to indicate that dislikes are not supported.
- Obsoleted `Author.Title` in favor of `Author.ChannelTitle` for consistency with other properties.
- [Converter] Fixed an issue where downloading a video with subtitles resulted in a truncated video file.

### v6.1.1 (15-Apr-2022)

- Fixed an issue which caused `MissingMethodException` to be thrown when using YoutubeExplode from a project with assembly trimming enabled.

### v6.1 (20-Feb-2022)

- Added `IsAudioOnly` property to `Container`. If this property evaluates to `true`, the container is guaranteed to not contain any video streams. If it evaluates to `false`, the container may or may not contain video streams.
- [Converter] Added an overload of `VideoClient.DownloadAsync(...)` that allows muxing specified streams and closed caption tracks into a single container. Closed captions are embedded inside the container as soft subtitles.
- [Converter] Obsoleted `Container.IsAudioOnly()` extension method. Use the newly added property instead.

### v6.0.8 (10-Feb-2022)

- Added handling for video URLs in YouTube Shorts format. (Thanks [@wellWINeo](https://github.com/wellWINeo))
- Added support for retrieving metadata of mix playlists using `PlaylistClient.GetAsync(...)`. (Thanks [@Roberto Blázquez](https://github.com/xBaank))
- Added `ChannelUrl` property to `Author`.
- Fixed an issue where attempting to retrieve certain auto-generated closed caption tracks threw an exception because of malformed data structure in the manifest. (Thanks [@AlmightyLks](https://github.com/AlmightyLks))
- [Converter] Obsoleted `YoutubeExplode.Converter.ConversionFormat` type. Going forward, use `YoutubeExplode.Videos.Streams.Container` instead.

### v6.0.7 (10-Dec-2021)

- Added an overload for `SearchClient.GetResultBatchesAsync(...)` that accepts a `SearchFilter` parameter. This parameter can be used to limit the query to only certain type of results (videos, playlists, channels) and avoid redundant requests.
- Updated implementations of `SearchClient.GetVideosAsync(...)`, `SearchClient.GetPlaylistsAsync(...)`, and `SearchClient.GetChannelsAsync(...)` to use the new overload. These methods should now execute faster on search queries that normally contain mixed results.
- [Converter] Fixed an issue where downloading a video to an `mp3` file incorrectly recorded the duration of the file as double of what it's supposed to be.

### v6.0.6 (09-Dec-2021)

- Fixed an issue which caused `Seek(...)` method on streams returned from `StreamClient.GetStreamAsync(...)` to move the stream into incorrect position.
- Fixed an issue which caused an exception when parsing closed captions that don't have timing information. (Thanks [@dbakuntsev](https://github.com/dbakuntsev))
- Fixed an issue which caused an exception when handling videos that had escape characters inside player config's JSON payload. (Thanks [@wleader](https://github.com/wleader))
- Fixed an issue where the streams returned from `StreamClient.GetStreamAsync(...)` were very slow to read. (Thanks [@Roberto Blázquez](https://github.com/xBaank))

### v6.0.5 (29-Jul-2021)

- Fixed an issue where trying to get stream or closed caption manifest failed on some videos with 404 HTTP error due to recent YouTube changes.
- Fixed an issue where some videos contained incorrect video quality labels.

Known issues: `StreamClient.GetHttpLiveStreamUrlAsync(...)` does not work and throws exceptions on every video, including valid livestreams ([#566](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeExplode/issues/566)).

### v6.0.2 (28-May-2021)

- Fixed an issue where trying to get stream manifest of videos with HDR streams failed with exception.

### v6.0.1 (21-May-2021)

- Fixed an issue where trying to get stream manifest failed on some videos with 404 HTTP error due to recent YouTube changes.
- Fixed an issue where trying to get stream manifest occasionally resulted in a `FormatException`.
- Fixed an issue where some required cookies were not passed along with requests, which caused them to fail.

### v6.0 (17-Apr-2021)

- Fixed an issue where an attempt to get playlist metadata or playlist videos resulted in an exception, due to YouTube's recent changes.
- Fixed an issue where an attempt to get videos returned by a search query resulted in an exception, due to YouTube's recent changes.
- Fixed an issue where an attempt to get video metadata resulted in an exception, due to YouTube's recent changes.
- Fixed an issue where some age-restricted videos were reported as unplayable, due to YouTube's recent changes.
- Fixed an issue where `av01`-encoded video-only streams were occasionally missing from the resolved stream manifest.
- Fixed many other issues brought on by recent YouTube changes.
- Changes to videos:
  - Changed `Video.Duration` to a nullable property. It may be `null` on videos that haven't finished yet (i.e. ongoing livestreams).
  - Changed `Video.Author` type from `string` to `Author` object, which encapsulates both channel ID and channel title. Removed `Video.ChannelId`.
  - Changed `Video.Thumbnails` type from `ThumbnailSet` to `IReadOnlyList<Thumbnail>`.
  - Removed public constructor from `VideoId`. To create an instance of `VideoId`, use `VideoId.Parse(...)`, `VideoId.TryParse(...)`, or the implicit conversion from `string` to `VideoId`.
  - Changes to streams:
    - Removed `IStreamInfo.Tag` property.
    - Reworked `VideoQuality` into a struct (from an enum) which encapsulates video quality label, maximum height, and framerate. Removed `IVideoStreamInfo.VideoQualityLabel` and `IVideoStreamInfo.Framerate` in favor of this new consolidated type.
    - Renamed extension method `WithHighestBitrate(...)` to `TryGetWithHighestBitrate(...)`. Also added `GetWithHighestBitrate(...)` which does not return `null`, but instead throws if the source sequence is empty.
    - Renamed extension method `WithHighestVideoQuality(...)` to `TryGetWithHighestVideoQuality(...)`. Also added `GetWithHighestVideoQuality(...)` which does not return `null`, but instead throws if the source sequence is empty.
    - Changed the behavior of `TryGetWithHighestVideoQuality(...)` and `GetWithHighestVideoQuality(...)` extension methods so that they now also take into account the framerate of the stream.
    - Removed `GetAllVideoQualityLabels(...)` extension method.
  - Changes to closed captions:
    - Added `ClosedCaptionManifest.GetByLanguage(...)`. It works like `ClosedCaptionManifest.TryGetByLanguage(...)` but throws an exception in case of failure instead of returning `null`.
    - Added `ClosedCaptionTrack.GetByTime(...)`. It works like `ClosedCaptionTrack.TryGetByTime(...)` but throws an exception in case of failure instead of returning `null`.
    - Added `ClosedCaption.GetPartByTime(...)`. It works like `ClosedCaption.TryGetPartByTime(...)` but throws an exception in case of failure instead of returning `null`.
- Changes to playlists:
  - Changed `Playlist.Author` type to `Author`. Note that this property is nullable because auto-generated playlists (mixed, topics, etc.) don't have an author.
  - Changed `Playlist.Thumbnails` type from `ThumbnailSet` to `IReadOnlyList<Thumbnail>`.
  - Videos contained within playlists are now of type `PlaylistVideo` instead of `Video`.
  - `PlaylistVideo` implements `IVideo` interface, which outlines properties shared with `Video`.
  - `PlaylistVideo` no longer contains some of the properties available on `Video`, specifically: `UploadDate`, `Description`, `Keywords`, and `Engagement`.
  - Changed `PlaylistVideo.Author` type to `Author`.
  - Added `PlaylistClient.GetVideoBatchesAsync(...)` which returns videos in batches, each encompassing one response from YouTube.
  - Removed the previously available parameters for specifying starting page and page count on `PlaylistClient.GetVideosAsync(...)`. It is no longer possible to specify the starting page altogether because the new endpoint used by YoutubeExplode does not have the concept of pages. If you need manual control over how many requests you make, use `PlaylistClient.GetVideoBatchesAsync(...)` instead.
  - Removed public constructor from `PlaylistId`. To create an instance of `PlaylistId`, use `PlaylistId.Parse(...)`, `PlaylistId.TryParse(...)`, or the implicit conversion from `string` to `PlaylistId`.
- Changes to search:
  - Search functionality is now using a different endpoint, which also returns channels and playlists in addition to just videos.
  - Added `VideoSearchResult`, `PlaylistSearchResult`, and `ChannelSearchResult` to represent the different possible result types. They implement `IVideo`, `IPlaylist`, and `IChannel` respectively.
  - Added `SearchClient.GetResultsAsync(...)` which returns instances of `ISearchResult`. You will need to match the instance with one of its possible implementations (`VideoSearchResult`, `PlaylistSearchResult`, or `ChannelSearchResult`) to extract detailed information.
  - Added `SearchClient.GetResultBatchesAsync(...)` that provides more granular control over how many requests are sent to YouTube, similar to `PlaylistClient.GetVideoBatchesAsync(...)`.
  - Added additional methods to filter results by type: `SearchClient.GetVideosAsync(...)`, `SearchClient.GetChannelsAsync(...)`, and `SearchClient.GetPlaylistsAsync(...)`. Under the hood, these methods call `SearchClient.GetResultsAsync(...)`.
- Changes to channels:
  - Removed `Channel.LogoUrl` in favor of `Channel.Thumbnails` of type `IReadOnlyList<Thumbnail>`.
  - Removed public constructor from `ChannelId`. To create an instance of `ChannelId`, use `ChannelId.Parse(...)`, `ChannelId.TryParse(...)`, or the implicit conversion from `string` to `ChannelId`.
  - Removed public constructor from `UserName`. To create an instance of `UserName`, use `UserName.Parse(...)`, `UserName.TryParse(...)`, or the implicit conversion from `string` to `UserName`.
- Renamed `VideoResolution` to `Resolution` and moved it from `YoutubeExplode.Video.Streams` namespace to `YoutubeExplode.Common`. This type is now also used in `Thumbnail` to specify the size of the thumbnail image.
- Added `TryGetWithHighestResolution(...)` and `GetWithHighestResolution(...)` extension methods on `IEnumerable<Thumbnail>`. These methods return the thumbnail with the highest resolution by area (width multiplied by height).
- Moved extension methods that enable `await` expressions on certain `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` instances from `YoutubeExplode` namespace to `YoutubeExplode.Common`. Remember to add corresponding using directive for this namespace when working with playlists or search.
- Renamed `BufferAsync(...)` extension method to `CollectAsync(...)`.
- Added `CancellationToken` parameter to all asynchronous client methods where it was previously missing.
- Consolidated exceptions into fewer types.

### v5.0.2 (24-Apr-2020)

- Added `TryParse` static method to `ChannelId`, `UserName`, `PlaylistId`, `VideoId` objects.
- Added an extension method to make it simpler to buffer an asynchronous list of videos in-memory. You can now do `var videos = await youtube.Playlist.GetVideosAsync(...)` on top of enumerating it with `await foreach`. The readme has been updated with new usage examples.
- Simplified exception messages.

### v5.0.1 (13-Apr-2020)

- Fixed an issue where searching for videos sometimes failed with an exception.
- Added missing operators for `FileSize`, `Bitrate`, `Framerate`, `VideoResolution`, `Container`, `Language`, `VideoId`, `PlaylistId`, `ChannelId`, `UserName`.

### v5.0 (12-Apr-2020)

- **Reworked the entire library from the ground up.**
- Video, playlist, channel IDs and usernames are now encapsulated in corresponding domain objects. This means that you no longer have to parse IDs manually -- e.g. if a method accepts a parameter of type `VideoId`, you can either specify an ID (`bnsUkE8i0tU`) or a URL (`https://youtube.com/watch?v=bnsUkE8i0tU`).
- Playlist videos and search results are now returned as `IAsyncEnumerable` so you can enumerate through them without worrying about making too many or too few requests. If you want to buffer them in-memory, you can use an extension method called `BufferAsync()`.
- Improved exceptions, exception messages, and everything related to exceptions. Additionally, all exception types now derive from `YoutubeExplodeException`, making them easier to catch.
- Added built-in retry mechanisms to work around transient errors on YouTube's side.
- Improved resilience of the library in general.
- Fixed an issue where attempts to download some videos were periodically causing 403 Forbidden.
- Fixed a metric ton of YouTube-related issues.
- Many, many others improvements that I didn't think to mention.
- Dropped .NET Framework v4.5 target in favor of v4.6.1 and .NET Standard v1.1 target in favor of v2.0.

### v4.7.16 (16-Mar-2020)

- Fixed an issue where attempts to download some videos were periodically causing 403 Forbidden.

### v4.7.15 (11-Mar-2020)

- Fixed some issues revolving around videos marked with "content warning".

### v4.7.14 (10-Mar-2020)

- Fixed an issue where `GetMediaStreamAsync` and `DownloadMediaStreamAsync` threw an exception due to recent YouTube changes. As a side effect, age-restricted videos may no longer work, at least until a new workaround is found.

### v4.7.13 (10-Feb-2020)

- Fixed an issue where `GetPlaylistAsync` only returned 200 videos for some larger playlists. Thanks [@polynoman](https://github.com/polynoman).

- Improved the implementation of `GetChannelAsync` so that it's more fast and works on channels without any uploaded videos.

### v4.6.3 (13-Jan-2019)

- Fixed an issue where closed caption tracks were sometimes missing whitespace between words in auto-generated tracks.
- Added an extension method to get all distinct video quality labels from a set -- `MediaStreamInfoSet.GetAllVideoQualityLabels`.

- Fixed an issue where `GetVideoMediaStreamInfosAsync` returned empty for live stream recording videos.

### v4.6.1 (03-Dec-2018)

- Fixed sporadic failures in `GetVideoAuthorChannelAsync` and `GetChannelIdAsync`.
- Re-added `VideoRequiresPurchaseException` as a child of `VideoUnplayableException`.

### v4.6 (23-Nov-2018)

- Switched majority of video-related parsing to a new approach, which allows circumventing signature deciphering, provides more info, and is marginally faster and more consistent. This makes `GetVideoMediaStreamInfosAsync` complete twice as fast, on average.
- Switched from itag-based property mapping to manual string parsing, which should be more stable in the long run.
- Added `MediaStreamInfoSet.ValidUntil` property which can be used to determine when the contained streams will expire.

### v4.5 (20-Oct-2018)

- Fixed an issue where external links were truncated in `Video.Description` if they are too long.
- Added support for seeking in `MediaStream`.

### v4.4 (20-Oct-2018)

- Improved `GetVideoAsync`, `GetVideoAuthorChannelAsync` and `GetVideoClosedCaptionTrackInfosAsync` so that they don't fail on unavailable videos.
- Added extra result validation to `GetChannelIdAsync` to verify that the extracted value is indeed a valid channel ID.
- Added static methods to parse and validate YouTube usernames.

### v4.3.4 (16-Oct-2018)

- Fixed an issue where `JsonReaderException` was thrown on all videos due to recent YouTube changes.

### v4.3.2 (11-Sep-2018)

- Fixed an issue where `ParseException` was thrown on signature-protected videos due to recent YouTube changes.

### v4.3.1 (28-Aug-2018)

- Fixed an issue where retrieving some streams may throw a 403 HTTP error due to recent YouTube changes.

### v4.3 (25-Jul-2018)

- Reworked `GetMediaStreamAsync` so that it implements the workaround for rate-limited streams, which was originally only available in `DownloadMediaStreamAsync`. This is achieved by returning a stream that internally sends multiple segmented requests in a sequence.
- Fixed `MediaStream.ReadAsync` not using the `ReadAsync` of the underlying stream.
- Fixed `GetVideoQualityLabel` so that it displays the framerate as rounded up to the nearest 10, instead of always displaying it as '60'.

### v4.2.8 (14-Jun-2018)

- Fixed an issue where some non-embeddable videos could not be processed.

### v4.2.7 (09-Jun-2018)

- Fixed an issue where non-embeddable age-restricted videos could not be processed.
- Fixed exception messages not being shown in Visual Studio's exception popup.
- Fixed xml docs on `Playlist.Type` property.

### v4.2.6 (09-Jun-2018)

- Fixed an issue where `VideoUnavailableException` would always be thrown for non-embeddable videos due to recent YouTube changes.

### v4.2.5 (20-May-2018)

- Relaxed validation rules for all playlist IDs because there are even more variations than expected.

### v4.2.4 (02-May-2018)

- Fixed an issue where `GetVideoAuthorChannelAsync` would always throw an exception due to recent YouTube changes.

### v4.2.3 (22-Apr-2018)

- Added an extension method to parse `MediaStreamInfo.Url` expiry date -- `MediaStreamInfo.GetUrlExpiryDate`.
- Replaced instances of `DateTime` with `DateTimeOffset`.
- Relaxed validation rules for RD playlist IDs because there are simply too many possible variations.

### v4.2.2 (31-Mar-2018)

- Fixed some playlist IDs being considered invalid even though they aren't.

### v4.2.1 (28-Mar-2018)

- Fixed an `OutOfMemoryException` issue that would occur when executing `GetVideoMediaStreamInfosAsync` on a large video.

### v4.2 (24-Mar-2018)

- Added overloads for `DownloadMediaStreamAsync` and `DownloadClosedCaptionTrackAsync` that accept `Stream` as output.
- Removed `IHttpService`, `HttpService` in favor of using unwrapped `HttpClient`.

- Fixed an issue where some video qualities were not correctly identified due to itag inconsistency.
- Added support for 2880p video quality.

### v4.1 (02-Feb-2018)

- Implemented segmented downloading for rate-limited media streams. This fixes slow download speed of `DownloadMediaStreamAsync` caused by YouTube changes.
- Added `SearchVideosAsync` method to `YoutubeClient`. Can be used to search for videos using given query. The method returns `Video` objects but not all properties have valid values, due to how this internal API functions.
- Added `HlsLiveStreamUrl` to `MediaStreamInfoSet` which can be used to extract URL of M3U8 playlists for livestream videos.
- Added `UploadDate` to `Video`.
- Fixed incorrect return value in `GetVideoQualityLabel`/`VideoQualityLabel` in cases where FPS was below 60 but above 30.
- Renamed `GetRegularUrl` extension methods to `GetUrl`.
- Added some useful extension methods for models.
- Added some ReSharper annotations.

### v4.0 (15-Dec-2017)

- Reworked `YoutubeClient` API by splitting workflows into separate methods. What was done solely by `GetVideoAsync` is now done by `GetVideoAsync`, `GetVideoMediaStreamInfosAsync`, `GetVideoClosedCaptionTrackInfosAsync`, `GetVideoAuthorChannelAsync`.
- Media stream and closed caption track information is no longer part of the `Video` model. Extended channel information was also removed.
- `PlaylistVideo` has been removed as it now shares the same property set with `Video`. Existing usages of `PlaylistVideo` have been replaced with `Video`.
- Order of some parameters in `Playlist` constructor has been changed. Be careful if you initialize it yourself.
- Removed some properties from `Channel` that are no longer accessible due to YouTube changes.
- Exception messages now provide more information, without needing to check inside properties.
- `ValidatePlaylistId` and `(Try)ParsePlaylistId` are now more strict and check the first two characters in the ID as well.
- Added a lot of useful extensions methods. Refactored some existing methods to extensions.
- Fixed incompatibility with age-restricted videos due to YouTube changes.
- Fixed other issues that prevented the library from being usable due to YouTube changes.
- Added dependency on `Newtonsoft.Json` and `AngleSharp`.

This version has a lot of breaking changes and the migration isn't very straightforward. The readme has been updated with new usage examples and demo projects have been changed to work with new API.
